                    <p id="info">
                        Uncle Tom’s Cabin was an anti-slavery novel. This novel 
                        narrated the story of an enslaved man, showing him as a 
                        noble person. This portrayed the idea that slavery is 
                        unjust by conflicting with the idea that black people did 
                        not have as much emotional capacity as white people.

                        Harriet Beecher Stowe was prompted by the tightened Fugitive

                    <p id="info">
                        The author of the novel was Harriet Beecher Stowe. She was an 
                        abolitionist and was most likely motivated the spread her ideas 
                        on black people

                    <p id="info">
                        The novel had a major influence on how American citizens viewed 
                        slavery. The novel countered ideas that portrayed black people 
                        had limited emotional capacities. This caused many people to 
                        become against slavery, which further widened the gap between 
                        the north and south while also strengthening the north. The 
                        novel also helped gain favor for Abraham Lincoln, whose election 
                        also brought the United States closer to the Civil War.
