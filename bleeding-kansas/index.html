                        Bleeding Kansas was a period of time where there were 
                        repeated outbreaks of violence between pro-slavery and 
                        anti-slavery forces. During this time, about 55 people
                        were killed.

                    <p id="info">
                        John Brown was an abolitionist leader who fought in Bleeding 
                        Kansas. He was eventually executed for inciting a slave 
                        rebellion at Harpers Ferry.

                    <p id="info">
                        Bleeding Kansas emerged from the large political debates regarding 
                        if slavery should be legal in Kansas. If Kansas was to become a 
                        slave state, it would ultimately eliminate the Missouri Compromise. 
                        Eventually, this heated debate turned into violence, which was 
                        spread over four years.

                    <div id="subheader">How did it lead to the Civil War?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        The violence between pro-slavery and anti-slavery people was basically 
                        a mini-civil war, which established a precedent for the United States 
                        Civil War. Eventually, after the violence ceased, Kansas was voted as 
                        a free state due to antislavery settlers winning the population race. 
                        This angered pro-slavery settlers which created a larger divide between 
                        the two sides.
