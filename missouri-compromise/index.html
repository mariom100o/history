                    <p id="info">
                        The Missouri Compromise was federal legislation that 
                        prohibited slavery north of the 36° 30´ latitude line. 
                        This legislation exempted Missouri allowing it to be a 
                        slave state and admitted Maine as a free state. This was 
                        done in an effort to stop the north’s attempts to completely 
                        end slavery.

                    <p id="info">
                        Tensions were growing between the north and the south, which 
                        prompted the U.S Congress to pass this legislation in hopes of 
                        giving both sides what they wanted. This, however, was not the 
                        case.

                    <p id="info">
                        Henry Clay was a leading congressman who played a large role in the 
                        creation of the Missouri Compromise.

                    <p id="info">
                        Thirty years after its passing, the Missouri Compromise was ruled 
                        unconstitutional because both the north and south viewed it as unjust 
                        in their own ways. The south believed that the U.S Congress should not 
                        have the ability to regulate slavery. The north saw the Missouri Compromise 
                        as just a way to keep the nation in its current state and not allow it 
                        to move forward. After this ruling, many citizens rushed to vote for or
                        against slavery, which ultimately led to the event “Bleeding Kansas”, 
                        pushing the United States closer to Civil War.
