                        The Battle of Fort Sumter was the bombardment of Fort Sumter 
                        by the South Carolina militia. The United States Army returned 
                        gunfire and then eventually surrendered, where the Confederacy
                        won the battle.

                    <p id="info">
                        President Abraham Lincoln announced plans to resupply the fort, 
                        which prompted General P.G.T Beauregard to bombard Fort Sumter.

                        P.G.T. Beauregard led the South in the Battle of Fort Sumter. 
                        He was the Confederacy’s first brigadier general who ordered 
                        the first shots in the Battle of Fort Sumter.

                    <p id="info">
                        The Battle of Fort Sumter triggered the Civil War because it 
                        was the first time Confederates fired on a Union fort. That 
                        battle led to many more during the Civil war.
