                    <p id="info">
                        The Lecompton Institution was the second proposed constitution 
                        for the new state of Kansas. It was created by pro-slavery 
                        advocates who included provisions to protect slavery in the 
                        state and it excluded free black people from the bill of 
                        rights. This constitution never passed.

                    <p id="info">
                        The number of anti-slavery advocates greatly outnumbered the 
                        number of pro-slavery advocates in the vote, rejecting the 
                        Lecompton Institution 10,226 to 138.

                    <p id="info">
                        Not one specific person made proposed the constitution, 
                        but it was proposed by several pro-slavery advocates in 
                        Lecompton Kansas.

                    <p id="info">
                        The Lecompton Institution cause many northern Democrats to 
                        convert to the Republican party, and the rejection caused much 
                        turmoil in the Democratic Party. It also caused much more 
                        friction and conflict between the two parties, getting the 
                        United States closer to civil war.
