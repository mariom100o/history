                    <p id="info">
                        Due to the victory of Abraham Lincoln in the presidential election, 
                        South Carolina was the first state to secede from the federal Union. 
                        The South Carolina Declaration of Secession was issued by the South 
                        Carolina government in which they explain their reasonings for 
                        secession

                    <div id="subheader">Why?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        The South Carolina Declaration of Secession explains that the secession 
                        was due to the government failing to uphold its obligations to South Carolina. 
                        South Carolina asserted that one of the main issues was that some states 
                        did not enforce the Fugitive Slave Act and they believed the government 
                        has a role in abolishing slavery. The election of Abraham Lincoln ultimately 
                        pushed them to succeed because he was planning to abolish slavery.

                    <p id="info">
                        John C. Calhoun led the South Carolina secession. He served South Carolina 
                        as a representative, secretary of war, vice president, and senator.

                    <p id="info">
                        The secession of South Carolina prompted many more southern states to secede 
                        from the Union. The ten other states that seceded, along with South Carolina 
                        formed the Confederate States of America which fired on Fort Sumter, igniting 
                        the American Civil War.
