                    <p id="info">
                        Dred Scott v. Sandford was a legal case where the United States 
                        Supreme Court ruled that Dred Scott, who was a slave living in 
                        a free state, was not entitled to his freedom. This case struck 
                        the Missouri Compromise as unconstitutional and portrayed the 
                        idea that Congress had no power to abolish slavery in some
                        territories.

                    <p id="info">
                        Dred Scott, after serving multiple masters, tried to sue for his 
                        and his wife’s freedom. This however was not successful and his 
                        case led to more conflict.

                    <p id="info">
                        Dred Scott was an enslaved black man who attempted to sue for his 
                        freedom, which was unsuccessful. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled 
                        that African Americans cannot be citizens.

                    <div id="subheader">How did it lead to the Civil War?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        The decision made by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney outraged the 
                        abolitionists which led to many southern states seceding from the 
                        Union. This magnified the divide between anti-slavery and pro-slavery 
                        people. By striking the Missouri Compromise as unconstitutional, the 
                        case further angered abolitionists, pushing the United States closer 
                        to the Civil War.
