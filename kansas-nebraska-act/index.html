                    <p id="info">
                        The Kansas-Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise 
                        and created two new territories, Kansas and Nebraska. It 
                        also allowed these states to vote on whether slavery was 
                        legal or not. The act declared that slavery is legal in 
                        these areas.

                    <p id="info">
                        The bill was created to organize the territory of Nebraska 
                        which would eventually become Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, 
                        and the Dakotas.

                    <p id="info">
                        Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois proposed the bill to organize 
                        the Nebraska Territory. He hoped that his idea of popular sovereignty 
                        in the bill would resolve the issues over slavery in the United States.

                    <div id="subheader">How did it lead to the Civil War?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        The Kansas-Nebraska Act practically eliminated the Missouri Compromise, 
                        which has been holding the United States from breaking out into Civil 
                        War for thirty years. It allowed slavery in territories in which it
                        was once banned. This strengthened the conflict between the north and 
                        the south. The act also lead to the period called Bleeding Kansas, which 
                        even further pushed the United States closer to Civil War.
