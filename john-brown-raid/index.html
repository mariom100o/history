                    <p id="info">
                        John Brown’s Raid on Harpers Ferry was an effort made by John 
                        Brown to initiate a slave revolt in the Southern states. John 
                        Brown along with a small group of abolitionists raided a federal 
                        arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia, trying to arm enslaved people 
                        and destroy slavery itself. From the raid, seventeen people 
                        were killed and many of the abolitionists, including John Brown, 
                        were jailed facing charges of murder.

                    <div id="subheader">Why?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        John Brown wanted to weaken the slavery institution, and completely 
                        eliminate slavery. He would do this by arming enslaved people and 
                        starting a slave revolt.

                    <div id="subheader">Who?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        John Brown initiated the raid in hopes of completely eliminating slavery 
                        itself. Because of this, he was charged with murder and eventually 
                        executed for his crimes.

                    <p id="info">
                        Even though the raid was unsuccessful in completing John Brown’s wishes it 
                        made sure there would be no accommodation between the north and south, 
                        basically making the civil war inevitable.  It also worked as a precedent 
                        for the Civil War, modeling the actual United States Civil War.
