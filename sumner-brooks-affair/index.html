                    <p id="info">
                        The Sumner-Brooks affair was an altercation between Representative 
                        Preston Brooks, who was a pro-slavery Democrat from South Carolina, 
                        and Senator Charles Sumner, who was an abolitionist Republican from 
                        Massachusetts. Preston Brooks used a walking cane to physically 
                        attack Charles Sumner, beating him nearly to death.

                    <p id="info">
                        During Charles Sumner’s anti-slavery speech, he verbally attacked 
                        Preston Brooks’ first cousin once removed. This filled Brooks with 
                        anger leading him to attacking Sumner with a walking cane.

                    <p id="info">
                        Preston Brooks was an American politician who was a member of the 
                        United States House of Representatives from South Carolina. He was 
                        a Democrat who was strongly in favor of slavery. He is most widely 
                        known for attacking Charles Sumner in the United States Senate chamber.

                    <p id="info">
                        The beating significantly contributed to the division of pro-slavery and 
                        anti-slavery people. The use of violence was showcased by Preston Brooks 
                        eventually led to the Civil War.
