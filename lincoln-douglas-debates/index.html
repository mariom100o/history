                        The Lincoln Douglas Debates were a series of seven debates 
                        held between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas during 
                        the Illinois senatorial campaign. The issues discussed in 
                        the debates were mainly about the issues of slavery.

                        Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party candidate for the 
                        United States Senate from Illinois debated with Democratic 
                        Party candidate, Senator Stephen Douglas.

                    <p id="info">
                        The debates strengthened the divide between the parties and 
                        Lincoln portrayed Douglas as upholding a “wrong”.  The debates
                        gained Lincoln some favor for the upcoming presidential 
                        election, in which he will win, which also pushed the United 
                        States closer to civil war.
