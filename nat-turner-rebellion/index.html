                    <p id="info">
                        Nat Turner’s Rebellion was a four-day rebellion of enslaved 
                        Virginians which was led by Nat Turner. Nat Turner enlisted 
                        around 70 blacks, free and enslaved. These men would travel 
                        to several houses to free black slaves and kill white people, 
                        of all ages and genders. From this, about 60 white Americans 
                        died, before the rebellion was suppressed by the militia.

                    <p id="info">
                        Nat Turner wanted to spread the idea that slave-holding is in 
                        reality extremely brutal. He hoped to change the attitudes of 
                        many white people.

                    <p id="info">
                        Nat Turner led the rebellion. He was an enslaved black male 
                        preacher. He believed it was his God-given duty to “slay my 
                        own enemies with their own weapon.”

                    <div id="subheader">How did it lead to the Civil War?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        This rebellion further strengthened abolitionists’ ideas that 
                        slaves were not happy in their current states. It was argued 
                        in John C. Calhoun’s speech, “Slavery as a positive good” that 
                        slaves would not do anything productive with their life if they 
                        had been free. He further argues that slaves get hospitalization 
                        from their masters, showcasing the positives for slaves. However, 
                        Nat Turner’s Rebellion clearly showed that slaves were not happy 
                        with where they currently are. This set the stage for the Civil 
                        War by further increasing debates.
