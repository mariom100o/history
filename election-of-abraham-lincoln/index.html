                        During the sixteenth presidential election, Abraham Lincoln faced 
                        Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. Abraham Lincoln won the national 
                        popular plurality, the popular majority in northern states where 
                        slavery was already abolished, and the national electoral majority, 
                        which only comprised of northern electoral votes.

                    <p id="info">
                        Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer in Kentucky and Whig representative to 
                        Congress. Eventually, he gained a seat in the United States Senate 
                        before winning the presidential election.

                    <p id="info">
                        Because Abraham Lincoln was directly opposed to the expansion of slavery, 
                        his election did not settle well win many pro-slavery citizens. His 
                        election also initiated the secession of many southern states from the 
                        Union.  His large unpopularity among southerners and the secession of 
                        southern states brought the United States extremely close to civil war.
