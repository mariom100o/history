                    <p id="info">
                        The Wilmot Proviso was an amendment to President K. Polk’s 
                        appropriation bill regarding the funding of newly acquired 
                        territories. Along with changing Polk’s appropriation, it 
                        also prevented the expansion of slavery into territories 
                        acquired from Mexico due to the Mexican-American war. This 
                        amendment did not pass as it was defeated in the Senate.

                    <p id="info">
                        It was designed to remove slavery from land that was acquired 
                        by America in the Mexican-American war. Since David Wilmot did 
                        not want the creation of more pro-slave states.

                    <div id="subheader">Who?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        David Wilmot, who was a Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman, 
                        issued the Wilmot Proviso. He was against the expansion of 
                        slavery into other states.

                    <p id="info">
                        Even though the amendment did not become law, it still divided 
                        the Democratic Party between northerners and southerners since 
                        there were disagreements between ideas regarding slavery in newly 
                        acquired territories. Since the south heavily relied on slavery, 
                        the Wilmot Proviso was seen as an attack on them, inching the 
                        United States closer to the civil war.
