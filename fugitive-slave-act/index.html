                    <p id="info">
                        The Fugitive Slave act was one part of the Compromise of 
                        1850 in which southerners were allowed to retrieve runaway 
                        slaves from free states. This act also requires northerners 
                        to return any slaves to their masters in the south if found, 
                        completely undermining the ideas of the northerners.

                    <p id="info">
                        Henry Clay was pressured by the southern politicians, leading to 
                        the inclusion of the Fugitive Slave Act in the Compromise of 1850 
                        in order to please the south.

                    <p id="info">
                        Henry Clay established the Fugitive Slave Act as part of his Compromise 
                        of 1850. This was an effort to tone down the conflict between the north 
                        and the south.

                    <div id="subheader">How did it lead to the Civil War?</div>
                    <p id="info">
                        The fugitive slave act was one of the most controversial acts that were 
                        passed in the United States. By requiring the citizens in free states to 
                        capture and return runaway slaves, the act completely undermines the 
                        thoughts and beliefs of the northerners. It also creates the opportunity 
                        for free black people to be falsely captured back into slavery. This lead 
                        to a major uproar in the northern states and created extreme conflict 
                        between the north and south, getting the United States very close to the 
                        Civil War.
